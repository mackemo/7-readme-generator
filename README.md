  ## Process
  The process included downlaoding the inquirer package that was provided from the starter code by the command 'npm i'. I included variables that required each file I needed including fs, inquirer, and generateMarkdown file. I created a set of questions that asks for the user's input for sections of their README. This was all contained in the questions object. I had to write to the file with the filename the user inputted and I addded .md to the end of the file. The function init when called prompted the inquirer questions then wrote the file to the filename. The generateMarkdown file included switch statements for the different badges and badge links. A function in the file created the license section. Last but not least, the generate markdown function targeted each answer from the inquirer questions and put the answers into markdown language for the new file created. This is how the readme generator was created.
